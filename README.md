# Factors Contributing to Roadside Work Zone Collisions
## Abstract
Identifying factors that contribute to the probability of roadside work zone collisions enables decision makers to assess and control the risk of scheduling a particular maintenance or construction activity by modifying the characteristics of the operation. This can be achieved by studying the effect of work zone properties on the risk  of roadside work zone collisions. Much of the existing work in this area is based on data in the police traffic collision reports which do not include data on the characteristics of the work zone itself. This paper develops a comprehensive data set of 42 features describing time, location, work zone characteristics, traffic volume, and road properties. This extensive set of features allows for more accurate analysis deriving the effect of each feature on the risk  of work zone collisions. Our statistical analysis reveals 10 important features and shows that four of these features are the most significant in influencing collision risk for a work zone.
